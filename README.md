To select Model you can either pass a local model by selecting the directory of the model or one from huggingface.co/mdoels in this style username/modelname (g.e. unsloth/tinyllama)
To select a dataset the same approach can be used either local or from huggingface. For local you have to select a file.

The quantization Q8 will be default. With Q4 you can save up around 50% memory while sacrificing precision.
